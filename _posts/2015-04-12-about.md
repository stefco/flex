I'm a first year physics Ph.D. student at Columbia university. I'm interested in
gravitational wave astronomy and computational physics. As and undergraduate at
Columbia, I worked with [Professor Szabolcs Marka](http://markalab.org)
to develop and test [Advanced LIGO's](http://www.ligo.org) timing 
system, and will be looking at results from LIGO's first science run over the
summer.

I'm currently working with [Professor Brian Greene](http://www.briangreene.org)
and two other Columbia physics students
on a set of [simple, open-web-standards-based physics simulations for demonstrating 
interesting phenomena](http://stefco.github.io/physics-simulations/).
Though the technology for them exists, there are few elegant, open-source, 
cross-browser-compatible physics simulations. We're hopeful that our work will 
combine with the great, free physics lectures (and other resources) already on the 
internet to make learning physics more accessible than ever before. The first round
of demonstrations is targeted at improving and extending existing course materials
for [World Science U](http://www.worldscienceu.com).

I've worked for many years as a private tutor and as a TA. I'm currently TAing
Columbia's [Intermediate/Advanced EKA Physics 
Lab](http://www.phys.columbia.edu/~w3081/EKA_Org.html) as well as the 
Electronics Lab. In the past, I've TAed College Algebra, Calculus I-III, and 
Linear Algebra for Columbia's Math Department.

Besides physics, I love math, computer science, design, and fashion. I'm starting
this blog partly as a way of (I hope) cogently sharing some of my experiences and
perceptions with whoever might be interested.
